     What is Quantum Computing </h1>
   <p>Whether you know it or not, quantum physics touches our lives each day. Everything physical around us is made of matter, from the air we breathe to the water we drink—even our own bodies are made of matter. In its smallest measurable form, matter is made up of atoms. Within atoms are even smaller particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons—and protons and neutrons are made of even smaller units of matter called quarks.</p>
   <p>Quantum physics is the study of these extremely small atomic particles and quarks. Quantum aims to understand the nature of energy and matter through these small particles in order to better understand the world around us and apply quantum theories to real-world technology solutions.</p>
   <p>Applied quantum science is a foundational part of many components in many modern technologies, including cell phones and computers. In quantum computing, predictions are given in terms of probability, which allows us to find answers that traditional computers cannot provide.</p>
   <h1 id="HowDoesSCaNUseQuantumTechnologies?">How Does SCaN Use Quantum Technologies?</h1>
   <p>Rapid advances in quantum optics, driven by progress in micro-fabrication technologies, precision measurements, and development of coherent radiation sources, have recently enabled space-based demonstrations of new communications and networking technologies and protocols.</p>
   <p>Leveraging optical communications, the second quantum revolution promises to significantly improve NASA’s mission in various scientific, exploration, and technological enterprises, but especially in space-to-ground and deep space communications and navigation. In free space, quantum communications and navigation will almost exclusively be based on optical channels and platforms. This is a capability NASA SCaN is actively striving and planning for. NASA will be advancing technology and capabilities in partnership with other government agencies as well as the commercial sector, which will be key to creating economic opportunities and national growth.</p>
   <p>SCaN utilizes quantum technologies in a number of ways:</p>
   <h1 id="AtomicClocks">Atomic Clocks</h1>
   <p>Atomic clocks, ultra-precise clocks used in every GPS device and smartphone, work thanks to quantum mechanics. Atomic clocks on satellites orbiting Earth allow our devices to determine their locations. The satellites send signals from space, and the receiver triangulates your position by measuring how long the signals take to reach your GPS. Future technology will expand on this principle with deep space atomic clocks. Currently, spacecraft flying beyond Earth’s orbit don’t have a GPS to find their way through space. Atomic clocks on GPS satellites aren’t accurate enough to send directions to spacecraft, when being off by even less than a second could mean missing a planet by miles. The Deep Space Atomic Clock was the first atomic clock designed to fly onboard a spacecraft that goes beyond Earth’s orbit, dramatically improving the process.</p>
   <h1 id="Optical(Laser)Communications">Optical (Laser) Communications:</h1>
   <p>Lasers were developed based on our understanding of quantum mechanics. Quantum networking technology will build on the successes of laser communications to provide a host of new benefits over optical links: improved security, better timing, and even higher data rates.</p> 
   <p>Additionally, SCaN is partnering with other U.S. government agencies to research and develop capabilities in quantum information science (QIS), including in areas of adaptive optics, synchronization, detectors, and development of quantum use cases and applications. NASA will be advancing technology and capabilities in partnership with other government agencies as well as the commercial sector, which will be key to creating economic opportunities and national growth.</p>
